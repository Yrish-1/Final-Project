            <p>Hyper Text Markup Language(HTML)</p><br>
            <p>I am not an expert when it comes to maximizing HTML but I am learning and exploring. I put this on my skills because I do believe that HTML is a great programming site that will improve my skills in programming and designing. Furthermore, I have an experience creating an HTML website because of our capstone project.</p>

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)</p>
            <p>This is the twin of HTML, this style allowed me to design my HTML website. At first, I was really confused and I do not know how to utilize it but after studying it and watching videos about it, I was amazed and I said to myself that I will improve my skills in this. Right now, I can say that CSS is one of my skill that I can be proud of because it gave my website a beautiful design and transition. </p>

            <h1>Designing Website using HTML for Capstone Project for Non-Numeric Students from San Juan, Batangas</h1>
            <p>This project was designed and originally was HTML website but became an application that students from our past school can download.</p>
            <p>This application/HTML website is composed of different navigation such as the homepage, Building Mathematical Foundation which has user interface where user can tap it and different topics on basic mathematics will appear.The user can click on the topic they wanted and a link going to a youtube video tutorial which was originally created by the proponent(by yours truly).Moreover, Interactive minigames for students to test their understanding about the tutorial while having fun and challenged.Lastly, About us, which is about the proponents and the mission and vision of the group.This project aligns with my chosen SDG goal which is Quality Education and also connected to my chosen program.</p>
